Is there such a book that once you've read it every other book becomes optional? The ultimate must-read? 
Is it War and Peace, a huge novel by Leo Tolstoy, or is one of O'Henry's short stories that would make you omniscent?
I've got no opinion on the topic, but here's code that will help you to determine which book you best read in order to prepare
for FCE :)
